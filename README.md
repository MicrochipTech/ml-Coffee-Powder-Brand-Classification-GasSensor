# ☕ Coffee Bean Classifier – Gas Sensing + Embedded ML  

This project demonstrates how **embedded machine learning** can be used to classify different coffee brands using **gas sensing technology**. By leveraging the **BME688 4-in-1 environmental sensor** and **Microchip’s PIC32CX-BZ2 / WBZ451 microcontrollers**, we built a complete workflow from **data collection → model training → deployment on hardware**.  

The project highlights how **low-cost sensors** and **TinyML techniques** can be applied to real-world use cases such as **food authentication, air quality monitoring, and industrial predictive maintenance**.

## 🔎 Project Summary
- **Problem:** Coffee authenticity and quality control are often expensive and require lab-grade instruments.  
- **Solution:** Use gas sensor readings (VOC/VSC, carbon monoxide, hydrogen signatures) + embedded ML to classify coffee brands in real time.  
- **Approach:**  
  1. Capture sensor data from different coffee brands.  
  2. Train an ML classifier using Microchip’s MPLAB ML Development Suite.  
  3. Deploy the model on a low-power PIC32CX-BZ2 MCU for on-device inference.

## 🛠️ Hardware Setup
- **2 × PIC32CX-BZ2 / WBZ451 Curiosity Boards**  
  - One board + **BME688 sensor** inside a sealed jar with coffee (sensor node).  
  - Second board connected to PC via USB (host node).  
- **BME688 Environmental Sensor** – measures temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas resistance.  
- **3.7V Li-Po Battery Pack** – powers the sensor node for portable operation.
